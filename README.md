Overview
========

Welcome to Astronomer! This readme describes the contents of the project, as well as how to run Apache Airflow on your local machine.

Project Contents
================

Your Astro project contains the following files and folders:

- dags: This folder contains the Python files for your Airflow DAGs. By default, this directory includes one example DAG:
    - `example_astronauts`: This DAG shows a simple ETL pipeline example that queries the list of astronauts currently in space from the Open Notify API and prints a statement for each astronaut. The DAG uses the TaskFlow API to define tasks in Python, and dynamic task mapping to dynamically print a statement for each astronaut. For more on how this DAG works, see our [Getting started tutorial](https://www.astronomer.io/docs/learn/get-started-with-airflow).
- Dockerfile: This file contains a versioned Astro Runtime Docker image that provides a differentiated Airflow experience. If you want to execute other commands or overrides at runtime, specify them here.
- include: This folder contains any additional files that you want to include as part of your project. It is empty by default.
- packages.txt: Install OS-level packages needed for your project by adding them to this file. It is empty by default.
- requirements.txt: Install Python packages needed for your project by adding them to this file. It is empty by default.
- plugins: Add custom or community plugins for your project to this file. It is empty by default.
- airflow_settings.yaml: Use this local-only file to specify Airflow Connections, Variables, and Pools instead of entering them in the Airflow UI as you develop DAGs in this project.



# airflow_dbt_demo

# Steps
## 1. install astro cosmos
## 2. Initiate project - astro dev init
## 3. Make changes in the Docket file and requirement.txt as per the code below.
## 4. Start astro project - astro dev start
## 5. Airflow page put admin as username and password.
## 6. Create a new folder dbt under folder dag.
## 7. Move your DBT project to dag>dbt>"your-project"
## 8. Create dbt_dag.py as per the code below in root folder.
## 9. Refresh airflow page

### Deploy on Airflow

Update Dockerfile

```docker
RUN python -m venv dbt_venv && source dbt_venv/bin/activate && \
    pip install --no-cache-dir dbt-snowflake && deactivate
```

Update requirements.txt

```
astronomer-cosmos
apache-airflow-providers-snowflake
```

Add snowflake_conn in UI

```json
{
  "account": "<account_locator>-<account_name>",
  "warehouse": "dbt_wh",
  "database": "dbt_db",
  "role": "dbt_role",
  "insecure_mode": false
}
```

Create `dbt_dag.py`

```python
import os
from datetime import datetime

from cosmos import DbtDag, ProjectConfig, ProfileConfig, ExecutionConfig
from cosmos.profiles import SnowflakeUserPasswordProfileMapping

profile_config = ProfileConfig(
    profile_name="default",
    target_name="dev",
    profile_mapping=SnowflakeUserPasswordProfileMapping(
        conn_id="snowflake_conn", 
        profile_args={"database": "dbt_db", "schema": "dbt_schema"},
    )
)

dbt_snowflake_dag = DbtDag(
    project_config=ProjectConfig("/usr/local/airflow/dags/dbt/data_pipeline",),
    operator_args={"install_deps": True},
    profile_config=profile_config,
    execution_config=ExecutionConfig(dbt_executable_path=f"{os.environ['AIRFLOW_HOME']}/dbt_venv/bin/dbt",),
    schedule_interval="@daily",
    start_date=datetime(2023, 9, 10),
    catchup=False,
    dag_id="dbt_dag",
)
```
